# epub2go-web
A simple Website to provide a `NNI (Non-Nerd Interface)` to [epub2go.py](https://github.com/eneller/epub2go.py), a web to epub converter.

## Development
This project uses [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) for file watching and reloading.
Follow the [official instructions](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) for your system to install, django will default to its standard watcher otherwise.
